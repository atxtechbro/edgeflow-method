# Background Learning Agent

A real example case study of long-term momentum gain versus short-term dopamine hit: When troubleshooting test reports, developers often discover valuable shortcuts (like simplified ways to access WSL files from Windows). Instead of solidifying this deep learning opportunity, we typically move on to the next task.

Proposal: Create a background runner that monitors for long-term learning opportunities without trying to control developers or forcing them to be "janitors." This agent would observe valuable patterns, techniques, and solutions that emerge during development work, then automatically create PRs for human review that document these insights. Rather than interrupting flow, it would silently capture knowledge that would otherwise be lost, transforming ephemeral discoveries into persistent team assets.

This approach respects developer autonomy while still optimizing for long-term momentum, creating a system where learning compounds without requiring constant manual curation.
