The capability of AI systems to process, integrate, and reason across multiple types of data representations (modalities) such as text, images, audio, video, and structured data. This integration enables agents to form multidimensional internal representations that more closely approximate the richness of real-world phenomena, capturing complementary aspects that single modalities miss.
