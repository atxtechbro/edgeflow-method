# Agent-Human Bidirectional Flywheel

This diagram illustrates a balanced approach to human-AI interaction designed to preserve and enhance human agency rather than diminish it through dependency.

## Key Concepts

1. **Bidirectional Adaptation**: Rather than a one-way service relationship, the system establishes mutual growth where both agent and human evolve through interaction.

2. **Agency Preservation**: The agent intentionally monitors for signs of human dependency and adjusts its support to maintain human autonomy.

3. **Skill Development**: Instead of solving problems for humans, the agent scaffolds learning experiences that build human capabilities.

4. **Measurement Framework**: The system includes mechanisms to measure human agency and autonomy to ensure the relationship remains beneficial.
