This term encapsulates the concept that an initial lack of sophistication in AI systems (prematurity) can actually be beneficial (advantage) for learning and cognitive development, similar to how human infants learn through exploratory and incremental processes rather than being pre-loaded with information.
The term connects:

The developmental aspect of learning over time
The intentional prematurity or initial simplicity
The counterintuitive advantage this provides

This concept challenges the common AI development approach of extensive pretraining with massive datasets, suggesting instead that allowing agents to develop capabilities through environmental interaction and self-improvement might lead to more generalizable intelligence.
